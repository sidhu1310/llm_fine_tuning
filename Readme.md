# LLM Fine-Tuning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach to training and optimizing the model with a custom dataset, allowing for specialized language understanding and response generation.

## Features

- **Dataset Preparation:** Preprocesses text data for fine-tuning.
- **Model Selection:** Utilizes pre-trained LLMs from Hugging Face or similar sources.
- **Fine-Tuning Process:** Trains the model using a supervised learning approach.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using loss functions and accuracy scores.
- **Inference Testing:** Generates outputs from the fine-tuned model for validation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **PyTorch or TensorFlow**
- **Required dependencies from requirements.txt (if available)**

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sidhu1310/llm_fine_tuning.git
   cd llm_fine_tuning
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the `llm_fine_tuning.ipynb` file in Jupyter.

## Usage

1. **Load Dataset:** Modify the notebook to use your dataset or provide a dataset path.
2. **Train the Model:** Run the fine-tuning cells in order.
3. **Evaluate the Model:** Analyze loss, accuracy, and other metrics.
4. **Run Inference:** Test the fine-tuned model with custom inputs.
5. **Save and Export:** Save the trained model for deployment.

## File Structure

- **llm\_fine\_tuning.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing the training pipeline.
- **data/** - Directory for storing datasets.
- **models/** - Directory for saving trained models.
- **requirements.txt** - Lists required Python packages.

## Environment Configuration

Modify the `.env` file or update the notebook to set parameters such as:

```env
MODEL_NAME=your_model_name_here
EPOCHS=5
BATCH_SIZE=16
```
